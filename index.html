<p>Web can be defined as number of computers communicating between each other to <b><em>send</em></b> and <b><em>receive</em></b> data.<br>
  <em>For example-</em> If you go to web page like udacity .com, the computer sends a <em><b>HTTP Request</em></b> to a <em><b>Server</em></b>, which looks for the desired HTML document and<em><b> sends</em></b> back the <em><b>Response</em></b z> to your<em><b> Web Browser</em></b>, which then interprets the data and shows it on your screen.<em><b> Graphica</em></b>l overview of how<em><b> Web</em></b> works can be found<a href ="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48230539/m-48742046"> here.</a>

-text content:<font color="blue">What we see</font><br>
-markup:<font color="blue">What it looks like</font><br>
-references to other documents:<font color="blue">Like images, videos etc</font><br>
-links to other pages:<font color="blue">From where you can navigate to other web page</font><br>
